Welcome to my personal blog where I write about nerdy things.

### About the author

I'm currently the Technical Program Manager for Industrial Software Solutions located in Bothell, WA, but I work remotely from my home in South Dakota. I wear a lot of hats including IT Manager, Web Developer, Software Developer, Technical Support, and Technical Sales Consultant. I also use Oxford commas.

I'm engaged to a beautiful woman, and we have three wonderful children.

In my spare time I write programs in a variety of languages, and I'm especially keen on cryptography.
